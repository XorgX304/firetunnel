Project Description:

   Firetunnel  is a free and open-source program for connecting multiple Firejail
   sandboxes on a virtualized Ethernet network. Applications  include  virtual
   private networks (VPN), overlay networks, peer-to-peer applications.

   The  tunnel encapsulates Ethernet frames in UDP packets. Each packet is
   authenticated independently with  BLAKE2  cryptographic  hash  function
   (https://blake2.net/).   The keys are derived from a common secret file
   installed on both client and server.

   The traffic is not encrypted. On Linux, several excellent programs  are
   already  providing military-grade encryption. Among them OpenVPN, stunnel,
   Wireguard.  If encryption is what you are looking for, Firetunnel should
   not  be  your choice.  However, we do some light-weight bit scrambling.
   Our goal is to avoid the data collection and the blacklist-based  traffic
   shaping going on some ISP networks.

   Setup and configuration are extremely easy.  For every single aspect of
   the tunnel we provide  sensible  defaults.   Everything  is  integrated
   seamlessly with Firejail.
