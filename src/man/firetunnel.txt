.SH NAME
Firetunnel \- Tunneling program for Firejail sandboxes
.SH SYNOPSIS
Start the server:
.PP
.RS
firetunnel --server [OPTIONS]
.RE
.PP
Start the client:
.PP
.RS
firetunnel [OPTIONS] server-ip-address
.RE
.PP
Start your Firejail sandboxes (on both client and server side):
.PP
.RS
firejail --tunnel application
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Firetunnel is a free and open-source program for connecting multiple Firejail sandboxes
on a virtualized Ethernet network. Applications include
virtual private networks (VPN), overlay networks, peer-to-peer applications.
.PP
The tunnel encapsulates Ethernet frames in UDP packets. Each packet is authenticated
independently with BLAKE2 cryptographic hash function (https://blake2.net/).
The keys are derived from a common secret file installed on both client and server.
.PP
The traffic is not encrypted. On Linux, several excellent programs are already
providing military-grade encryption. Among them OpenVPN, stunnel, Wireguard.
If this is what you are looking for, Firetunnel should not be your choice.
However, we do some light-weight bit scrambling.
Our goal is to avoid the data collection and the blacklist-based traffic shaping
going on some ISP networks.
.PP
Setup and configuration are extremely easy.
For every single aspect of the tunnel we provide sensible defaults.
Everything is integrated seamlessly with Firejail.
.PP
.SH ABOUT THE TUNNEL
The tunnel network is an overlay network with IP addresses in 10.10.20.0/24 range.
The server itself is the default gateway at 10.10.20.1.
It is also the place where your packets go out on the Internet using NAT.
.PP
MTU is calculated on the server side for the specific
tunnel configuration. The default value is 1426.
.PP
The tunnel uses header compression for MAC/IP/TCP layers. This results in
better response time due to the smaller packet sizes, and reduces the
probability of packet loss on slower connections.
.PP
You can change the defaults on the server side using \-\-netaddr, \-\-netmask, \-\-defaultgw and \-\-mtu.
The server will pass the configuration to the client and to your sandboxes.
.PP
The server also handles DNS. In /etc/firetunnel/firetunnel.config we list 8 public DNS servers
such as 1.1.1.1 and 9.9.9.9. At startup we test each one of them and pick up the fastest ones.
.PP
.SH USAGE
The server and the client must have the time synchronized within 10 seconds.
This shouldn't be a problem, by default most Linux distributions are running the NTP daemon.
Start by setting a common secret file in /etc/firetunnel/firetunnel.secret:
.PP
.RS
# cp summer.jpg /etc/firetunnel/firetunnel.secret
.RE
.PP
Any file will do as long as the same file is installed on both computers.
We recommend you configure the access permissions as follows:
.PP
.RS
# chmod 600 /etc/firetunnel/firetunnel.secret
.RE
.PP
SSH into your remote computer and start the server:
.PP
.RS
# firetunnel --server
.RE
.PP
In a different terminal on your home computer start the client:
.PP
.RS
# firetunnel 198.51.100.23
.RE
.PP
198.51.100.23 is in this example the remote server IP address.
By default we are using UDP port 1119.
In a few seconds you will see the client connecting and receiving the tunnel configuration:
.PP
.RS
2018-08-01 21:09:01 198.51.100.23:1119 connected
.br
2018-08-01 21:09:01 Tunnel: 10.10.20.0/24, default gw 10.10.20.1, mtu 1426
.br
2018-08-01 21:09:01 Tunnel: DNS 1.1.1.1, 208.67.222.222, 9.9.9.9
.br
.RE
.PP
All the commands above are entered as root. Time to switch back to your regular user
and start a few sandboxes:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail --tunnel firefox &
.br
$ firejail --tunnel transmission-qt &
.br
.RE
.PP
That's all that is, enjoy!

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print options end exit.

.TP
\fB\-\-bridge=device
Use this Linux bridge device to aggregate traffic into your tunnel. A kernel TAP device implementing the UDP transport
will be connected to this bridge. Firejail sandboxes will also be connected to this bridge.
Without this option, the default server bridge device is \fBfts\fR, and the client bridge device if \fBftc\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-daemonize
Detach from the controlling terminal and run as a Unix daemon.

.TP
\fB\-\-debug
Print debug information

.TP
\fB\-\-defaultgw=address
Tunnel default gateway address, default 10.10.20.1. The server bridge device is assigned this address.
Network address translation is implemented in the system firewall (netfilter) in order to access the outside world.

.TP
\fB\-\-dns=address
Add this DNS server to the list of DNS servers. The server will test each DNS server in the list
and pick up the fastest three.

.TP
\fB\-\-mtu=number
In the default configuration maximum transmission unit for the interfaces inside the tunnel is 1426.
Use this option on the server side of the tunnel to overwrite the default.

.TP
\fB\-\-netaddr=address
Tunnel network address, default 10.10.20.0.

.TP
\fB\-\-netmask=mask
Tunnel network mask, default 255.255.255.0.

.TP
\fB\-\-nonat
Network address translation disabled. The network traffic will remain in the tunnel network.

.TP
\fB\-\-noscrambling
Scrambling disabled, the packets are sent in clear.

.TP
\fB\-\-noseccomp
Whitelist seccomp filters are applied to firetunnel processes. The definitions for these filters
can be found in  /etc/firetunnel/firetunnel.config file. This option disables seccomp functionality.

.TP
\fB\-\-port=number
Server UDP port number, default 1119.

.TP
\fB\-\-profile=file
Extract the tunnel configuration from this profile file. The default configuration file is /etc/firejail/default.profile.

.TP
\fB\-\-server
Act as a server for the tunnel.

.TP
\fB\-\-version
Print software version and exit.

.SH PROFILE FILES
Most command line options can be passed to the program using profile files. The following commands
are implemented: daemonize, dns, bridge, defaultgw, mtu, netaddr, metmask, nonat, noscrambling, noseccomp, and server.
Use /etc/firejail/default.profile as an example.
